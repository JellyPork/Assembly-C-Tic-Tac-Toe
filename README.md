# Assembly/C++ TicTacToe

This Project was made as a school project in order to understand the use of assembly and combine a low-level language with a high-level language.

## How does it work?

The use of Windows Forms which is a framework in C++ that manages interfaces.

And some functions are made in Assembly that allow the verification, score and the player's turn.
